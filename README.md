# Henrik's Portfolio Website (Vue Edition)
This is my portfolio website - but rebuilt with Vue 3 and Nuxt 3. More information about my portfolio is [here](https://github.com/henrikvtcodes/website/blob/main/README.md). Other main difference is that I had to use a different icon library (Lucide, a fork of Feather Icons) due to compatibility issues. Vue is actually kinda cool - I should mess with it more often.
